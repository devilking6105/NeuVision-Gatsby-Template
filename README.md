## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

NeuVision is a Neumorphic Gatsby Template that is **AMP** ready, out of the package. You're Welcome.

The NeuVision template was created & designed by me, [Kayla Gordon](https://twitter.com/kayla_finland). If you want to work together, let's talk. ðŸš€

## AMP âš¡

To get AMP set up, all you need to do is add your website domain to the `gatsby-config.js` file (for the `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-canonical-urls` settings) and the `seo.js` component file.

### What do I update?

You need to replace "https://www.your-website.com" with your correct website domain.

Want an easy way to find it? In VS Code, do a search for "your-website" and voila!

## Any advice for the user login?

Yep! If you are using **AWS** for your user login and registration, here's a handy dandy tutorial to make life easier.
